/**
 * Job-object ownership for a ConPTY's process tree.
 *
 * Before this, Orca answered "is this tree mine, and how do I kill it?" by
 * scraping the process table, walking parent pids back to itself, and then
 * running `taskkill /T /F` only if the walk said yes. Every step of that is a
 * guess:
 *
 * - a pid walk cannot survive pid reuse, so teardown had to refuse whenever it
 *   was unsure, and a refused kill is an orphaned agent tree holding the
 *   worktree directory open (#9045, #10475, #10087);
 * - a descendant that reparented is invisible to the walk entirely;
 * - the scrape itself could be blocked by policy, which read as "no evidence".
 *
 * A job object replaces the inference with a handle. node-pty puts each shell
 * into its own job at creation, before it can spawn anything, so membership is
 * the kernel's answer rather than ours.
